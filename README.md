# Machine Learning Engineering in Action

The field of Data Science, although seemingly complex, is in essence an exploration of information and the patterns within.

Data science encompasses various methods and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This repository is devoted to a deeper understanding of data science, particularly Machine Learning Engineering, with exercises and solutions from the well-regarded book "Machine Learning Engineering in Action" (Wilson Ben, 2022).

The primary aim of this repository is to provide an accessible yet comprehensive resource to those embarking on their journey in the field of data science. The repository will provide explanations, solutions, and insights into the numerous exercises contained within the aforementioned book.
